# followed all rules and compiles/runs without modifications (2)

all good 👍


# quality of report (3)

Nice and to-the-point report.

[-0.5] maybe you zoomed in for the 60m and checked, but reading the report it wasn't mentioned, and general statements were made, eg "The clusters of cities and towns don't have clear geometric outline".

"However, the classification result of the 60m data (especially using Kmeans) shows the high dimensional data makes some features of ground objects inconspicuous, resulting in poor classification effect."
=> Where can I see this?

"In this assignment, SSE (Error Sum of Squares) is a good solution used to find the optimal K-value. The main idea of this solution is the value of SSE will decrease with the increase of K-value in general, but if the K-value is less than the optimal K-value, the SSE will decrease sharply. After K-value is greater than the optimal K-value, SSE decreases very slowly. Therefore, the goal is to find the turning point on the SSE curve, which is the optimal K-value position."
=> good idea, simply explained

# code (2)

all good and clear 👍

White being a class for water in [13] is slightly confusing I must admit


# analysis and explanation (quality/clarity)  (3)

[-0.5] classification result doesn't distinguish the estuary area and deep sea area.
=> should that be the case though? Water is the land cover (surface).

"For objects on cities and towns, the clusterings generated by KMeans are more fragmented than those generated by GMM."
=> you could zoomin and show one example next time

Nice that you have a table summarising all results
